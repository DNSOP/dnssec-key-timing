Initially, the document draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing-03 had 
gone through the working group and was in Working Group Last Call
(WGLC).  While there, the document stalled, more for lack of document
shepherding than lack of consensus.  Soon after, a companion document
titled draft-mekking-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing-bis appeared, and stalled
in a similar manner.

This version of the document (which will be published as -04) does
not reflect two documents. It is more a document driven by the
consensus of the WG (which was and still is "ship it"). Hence, this
does not include (m)any updates of the draft
draft-mekking-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing-bis.

The changes made in draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing are merely small
changes to make clearer that the states are related to the keys involved
in the rollover, and the states are not related to the rollover itself.


(from the Appendix on changes)

o  draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing-04	
 	      * Renamed to "DNSSEC Key Rollover Timing Considerations" to	
 	      emphasise that this draft concerns rollover timings.	
 	      * Updated 4641bis reference to RFC 6781.	
 	      * Add introductory paragraph to each rollover description	
 	      summarising its essential features.	
 	      * Remove detailed description of double-RRSIG ZSK rollover.  It is	
 	      extremely unlikely to be used in any practical situation.	
 	      * "Double-Signature" KSK rollover renamed to "Double-KSK" to avoid	
 	      confusion with the ZSK rollover of the same name.	
 	      * Removed section 2.3 (rollover summary) which just listed the	
 	      order in which records are published.	
 	      * Matthijs Mekking added as co-author.	
 		
 	      * Changed Lzsk and Kzsk definitions: actual lifetime instead of	
 	      intended lifetime.	
 	      * Update diagrams and text to better reflect key states and key	
 	      lifetimes.
