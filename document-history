Initially, the draft draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing-03 had been created and gone through the working group and had 
made it to Working Group Last Call (WGLC).  While there, the document stalled, more for lack of document shepherding than lack of consensus.    While this draft was in WGLC, Matthjis put together a companion draft draft-mekking-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing-bis, and updated the original document with detailed timelines on key rollovers. 

The consesus was made to bring the old drafts back to life. However, the ADs saw no benefit from moving a document and its updated version forward.  It was decided to make one document which would accurately reflect the two documents, without doing a large-scale rewrite of the draft.

(from the Appendix on changes)

o  draft-ietf-dnsop-dnssec-key-timing-04	
 	      * Renamed to "DNSSEC Key Rollover Timing Considerations" to	
 	      emphasise that this draft concerns rollover timings.	
 	      * Updated 4641bis reference to RFC 6781.	
 	      * Add introductory paragraph to each rollover description	
 	      summarising its essential features.	
 	      * Remove detailed description of double-RRSIG ZSK rollover.  It is	
 	      extremely unlikely to be used in any practical situation.	
 	      * "Double-Signature" KSK rollover renamed to "Double-KSK" to avoid	
 	      confusion with the ZSK rollover of the same name.	
 	      * Removed section 2.3 (rollover summary) which just listed the	
 	      order in which records are published.	
 	      * Matthijs Mekking added as co-author.	
 		
 	      * Changed Lzsk and Kzsk definitions: actual lifetime instead of	
 	      intended lifetime.	
 	      * Update diagrams and text to better reflect key states and key	
 	      lifetimes.
